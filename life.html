      In 2020 Luke was on tour in Europe when the pandemic hit. Like many
      artists his plans came to an abrupt halt. Luke spent his time at home
      writing the now popular pandemic song called, “Six Feet Apart.” The song’s
      lyrics are very relatable. It talks about missing loved ones. Luke misses
      his parents. It talks about what people will do when the pandemic over.
      Luke wants to eat out and go to a ball game. Finally, the lyrics address
      the uncertainty of the pandemic. Truthfully no one knows when this will be
      over.

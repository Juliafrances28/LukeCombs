      <p class="career">
        In 2020 Luke was on tour in Europe when the pandemic hit. Like many
        artists his plans came to an abrupt halt. Luke spent his time at home
        writing the now popular pandemic song called, “Six Feet Apart.” The
        song’s lyrics are very relatable. It talks about missing loved ones.
        Luke misses his parents. It talks about what people will do when the
        pandemic over. Luke wants to eat out and go to a ball game. Finally, the
        lyrics address the uncertainty of the pandemic. Truthfully no one knows
        when this will be over.
